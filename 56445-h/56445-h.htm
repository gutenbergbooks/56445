<p class="ph2">THE MANIA OF THE NATIONS<br />
ON THE PLANET MARS</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MANY millions of centuries ago, when
the celestial globe on which we live and
struggle started to emerge from the hot-air
habit and commenced to cool down and come to
its senses, a huge mass of syrup-like material sagged
down toward the lower end of the cooling ball and,
upon further cooling, formed a high promontory at
what we to-day call the South Pole. As a consequence
we now find there a plateau of an elevation
far exceeding in height the highest mountains found
elsewhere on our venerable globe.</p>

<p>You may imagine if you can how cold it must
be there. The North Pole is supposed to be cool
enough for anybody who hates to go to sleep in an
overheated bedroom; but it has been shown to be a
depression in the earth&#8217;s crust filled with ice, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
therefore does not mount far above sea level, while
the South Pole, aside from lacking the sun&#8217;s comforting
perpendicular rays, reaches besides so high
up in the atmospheric layers as to preclude all possibility
of the prevalence of hot birds. Cold bottles
are about the only means of enjoyment which the
tourists, thirsting for amusement, find there at their
disposal.</p>

<p>Professor <small>FANSEE</small> of the Dreemo University
was a courageous man. He may have been afflicted
with a creepy feeling in the still, mysterious shadows
of the night; he may have had a constant fear of
spooks and all sorts of ferocious beasts; he may have
stood in perpetual awe of his innocent-looking wife;
but it must be said to his everlasting glory that he
was not at all afraid of the cold. It is being whispered
that after many years of married life his affectionate
spouse had at last succeeded in more or less
accustoming him to frigidity.</p>

<p>Professor <small>FANSEE</small>, moreover, was an expert in
astronomy, chemistry and electricity. With a smile
of derision he had watched for years the futile efforts
on the part of certain scientists to communicate with
the planet Mars. Long ago an idea had ripened in
his fertile brain that he knew would ultimately lead
to the desired end. The highest plateau on earth
having been shown to be located at the South Pole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
he decided to direct his Zee-rays from this cool and
calm promontory. For this purpose he caused an
enormous hollow globe to be built of non-conducting
material, so arranged that the inner chambers
would retain an upright position while the ball would
be merrily rolling along. By means of powerful
storage batteries within this potent structure the apparatus
was made self-propelling. With this rolling
vehicle at his beck and call, he needed no ships
to cross the Antarctic ocean, no derricks to hoist his
globular observatory to the highest peak; and without
notifying the press, unostentatiously as befits a
serious-minded scientist, he arrived one fine morning
at the highest point of that celestial conveyance
which we call the earth.</p>

<p>From this elevation he industriously worked his
ingenious device. For six months he shot his Zee-rays
day and night at the unsuspecting Martians.
For six months his endeavors seemed utterly fruitless.
Then, of a sudden, in the middle of the night,
a faint wail was heard in the Professor&#8217;s receiving
apparatus; a manifestation of the first indication
that his brain-child had actually come into healthful
being. For two weeks, at intervals of twenty minutes,
Professor <small>FANSEE</small> cautiously manipulated his
quivering wires. Then, at last, to his unbounded
joy and satisfaction, the first communication from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Mars became intelligible. From that moment on,
it took but a few days to come to an understanding
with the mystic inhabitants of our misty neighbor;
and an interesting narrative was thus obtained of
conditions prevailing on the presumably canal-infested
planet.</p>

<p>Professor <small>FANSEE</small> unfortunately breathed his
last before returning to his native land. But I had
had the honor of acting as his assistant and confidant.
And although to my keen disappointment
the globe in which we traveled was wrecked on the
rocks while making a landing on the shores of New
Zealand, I had the good fortune of safely swimming
ashore and of saving the papers containing the interesting
revelations. So, with due credit to Professor
<small>FANSEE</small>, and with fond recollections of his
erudite personality, I believe myself justified in revealing
the Martian episode to my terrestrial fellowmen.</p>

<p>The marked similarity with events on our own
celestial empire may strike my readers as a singular
coincidence. But according to prehistoric astrologers,
all events are controlled by the position of the
stars. And, if they do control the course of events
on our earth, it seems but natural that they should
similarly affect some of the other members of our
solar system.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>First of all, as Professor <small>FANSEE</small> had always
been profoundly interested in questions of religion,
and as his first inquiries consequently dealt with
this highly important subject, it should be stated that
for eighteen centuries and a half the ruling religion
on the planet Mars had been the religion of
<small>NAZARRO</small>. <span class="smcap">Nazarro</span> was a God who, according
to the Martians, materialized in human form on
the planet Mars. This God preached a gospel of
peace, of the curbing of passions, and of equal division
of wealth. So the Roamani and the Heebrons,
among whom he dwelt, sought to punish His
revolutionary agitations by hanging Him on the gallows.
Thus the sign of the gallows became a sign
of sanctity revered by <small>NAZARRO&#8217;S</small> followers, and
the emblem of a new faith. The members of the
religious sect so created and which for fifteen centuries
continued to grow in power were known as
the Nazarranos.</p>

<p>About the end of the fifteenth century E.N.
(the Era of <small>NAZARRO</small>) the trend of civilization
commenced to take a somewhat different direction.
If the Nazarranos had limited themselves to spreading
the precepts of <small>NAZARRO</small> unchanged, our Martian
informer thought, all of the inhabitants of Mars
would unswervingly have recognized their excellence.
But only a few among the Martians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
mentally as lofty as had been the Great Nazarrano
Teacher. Consequently, when the Nazarranos organized
a Nazarrano corporation under the personal
direction of certain lower and higher functionaries,
these functionaries, supposedly for the honor of
<small>NAZARRO</small>, often resorted to methods of which
<small>NAZARRO</small> Himself would never have approved.
The unavoidable result was that certain Martians
seriously began to doubt the superiority of the whole
Nazarrano faith.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from remote antiquity down to
this interesting era, the minds of the Martians had
gradually developed to ever greater efficiency; and
it so happened that at this time they commenced to
investigate the phenomena of Nature far more systematically
than they had ever done before. In
connection with the Nazarrano faith a mystic story
had been preached of the creation of the Universe,
gathered from the Heebron manuscripts, and which
made the Martians believe that Mars was a flat slice
of land floating on water, around which the remainder
of the Universe majestically rotated. So when
a Martian by the name of <small>GALELIAH</small> discovered that
Mars was a globe, and that Mars rotated round
the Sun, and not the Sun around Mars, the Nazarrano
corporation officials strenuously objected, for
they saw in his suggestion the first signs of disbelief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Notwithstanding the opposition of the Nazarrano
officials, various sciences began to develop in other
directions, until the Nazarranos were forced, little
by little, to change their views of creation. In every
instance the Nazarrano dignitaries registered their
objections in vain with greater or lesser vehemence.
At last, in the year 1859 E.N., a new prophet
arose, bearing the euphonic name of <small>DARVINO</small>. In
the country of the Frank-Aulians, otherwise known
as the Fringe, a book had previously been published
by <small>LAMARCKEESO</small>, suggesting that the development
of the Universe was due to a process of evolution;
and the intrepid <small>DARVINO</small> rigged a ship to search for
proofs, and published these proofs convincingly in
the said memorable year 1859 E.N.</p>

<p>From that time on, a new faith began to conquer
the minds of the Martians. To a numerous
group of scientists the year 1861 E.N. became the
year 1 E.D. (Era of <small>DARVINO</small>). A new religious
sect came into being known as the Darvinianos.
And although a large majority of the Nazarranos
continued to profess their older faith, their views of
the Universe as well as their conceptions of proper
living were, nevertheless, ever more definitely influenced
by the Darviniano conclusions.</p>

<p>Now the belief in personal Gods, of which the
Nazarrano faith had been the latest outgrowth, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
prevailed on the planet Mars for innumerable centuries.
The Martian idea of morality had for an
almost unlimited era been taught to the young in so
close a connection with the faith in personal and
semi-human Deities, that it seemed to the Martians
that this faith was the rock on which moral conduct
was necessarily to be founded. The faith in personally
supervising Divinities had penetrated the
customs and moral conceptions not only of the Nazarranos,
but well nigh of all the Martian nations
and religious sects. It had grown to be to all appearances
inseparable from the Martians&#8217; way of
giving vent to their emotional longings and inclinations.
On the other hand, the Darviniano conclusions
contained nothing of an emotional nature.
They sprang from the intellect, and appealed to the
intellect only.</p>

<p>As the year 1859 E.N. on Mars corresponds
exactly with the year 1859 A.D. on earth, it may
readily be seen that at the time of Professor <small>FANSEE&#8217;S</small>
intercourse with our neighboring planet, the
Darviniano faith had prevailed only for a little over
half a century. Of course, new faiths, new religions,
new philosophies, cannot ripen to completeness in
so short a lapse of time. Hence, in order to satisfy
their emotional longings and moral desires, the Martians
continued to resort to the Nazarrano manuscripts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
adopting meanwhile the intellectual views of
the Darvinianos, and trying as best they could to
harmonize the two systems of thought. But try as
they might, they were ever and again confronted by
disturbing contradictions. This inevitably gave rise
to an unsettled emotional condition, which our Martian
informer indeed seemed deeply to deplore, but
which&mdash;in his clearly expressed opinion&mdash;would beyond
doubt make way for a renewed era of moral
stability and mental ease, so soon as the Darviniano
faith had been made more nearly complete&mdash;and
hence more satisfactory&mdash;by an infusion of the emotional
element.</p>

<p>Having in this way concisely explained the religious
situation on the whirling Canal-globe, our
informant, who evidently was an erudite philosopher
delegated for this purpose, suddenly changed the
subject in order that he might acquaint us with the
principal international political events that had occurred
on Mars during the Nazarrano era.</p>

<p>To our astonishment we received the unmistakable
impression that the social conditions on the
earthlike planet are as yet extremely primitive. It
seems that, in ancient times, those groups of Martians
who inhabited territories surrounded by mountains
and forests or bordered by oceans and rivers,
were forced to consider these natural boundaries as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
insurmountable barriers, and that these barriers
made their communication with other groups of
Martians almost impossible. Each of these groups
was thus for many long centuries constrained to lead
an isolated existence. The tribes that occupied one
valley never came in contact with the inhabitants of
other valleys. One group of Martians would dwell
at one side of some large forest; on the other side
some other group would be struggling along; but
the two groups never met to interchange their views
or to learn in what way the other had increased the
comforts of life. Naturally, therefore, each group
developed a language and crude civilization of its
own, and the result was the division of the inhabitants
of Mars into separate nations, each with its
own peculiar customs and ideals.</p>

<p>As science advanced, the communication between
these isolated nations was ever more facilitated,
and their mutual relations became ever more intimate.
At the time at which Professor <small>FANSEE</small> received his
remarkable message, perfect intercommunication had
been established by means of railroads, steamship
lines, telegraphs and telephones. The Martians had
even commenced to travel through the air from one
country to another. In this manner all the nations
were enabled to benefit by the scientific progress
made by any one of them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Now if each nation had been sufficient unto
itself, if each country had from its own resources
provided all the ingredients it needed under its more
progressive form of civilization, it might to an extent
have been sensible for the various groups of
Martians to say to one another: &#8220;We are mighty
glad to come in contact with you, and we are deeply
interested in your customs and ideals, which seem
at first sight so very much at variance with our own,
and which are nevertheless at bottom so very similar
to ours; but as we do not see the slightest benefit in
changing the conditions that be, we prefer not to
destroy our national individuality. For our national
pride has grown to be a sacred idol among us, with
which no higher ideals of a more expanded brotherhood
should be permitted to interfere.&#8221; But our
Martian informer stated that in actuality none of the
Martian nations really <i>is</i> sufficient unto itself. With
the broadened requirements of life which inevitably
followed in the wake of scientific development and
mental expansion, it was found that each nation produces
articles of some special type, of which all the
other nations are keenly and continually in need.
The soil of one country is rich in certain products
not found in other countries, even though these other
countries require them as well. In fact, it was soon
disclosed that all civilized nations are utterly dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
upon each other, both mentally and physically.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the unprejudiced
observer would naturally expect the nations to form
some sort of an alliance or federation for mutual
protection, and with a view to a sensible combination
of interests. Yet so short-sighted have been the
evidently narrow-minded Martians until now, that
they have utterly failed to take any such step. Nay,
instead of cooperating with each other, the nations
actually antagonize one another with blind stupidity.
Small-minded jealousies and hatreds, expressing
themselves especially in a peculiar international
science which the Martians call dip-low-macy, keep
the nations aloof from one another, and make sworn
hereditary enemies of nations that should entertain
naught but friendly and cooperative relations. Even
those nations which have acquired the same faith,
the same hopes, the same aspirations, continue to
lead their isolated national existence, carefully nursing
their mutual petty hatreds and malice against
other nationalities. Inasmuch as pretty nearly all
the Martian nations seem to be afflicted with this
malicious nationality-mania, the planet Mars, as
seen from the earth, inevitably makes the impression
of one vast lunatic asylum, nationality-mania being
the dreadful malady from which the Mars-bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
patients are unfortunately suffering. Their minds
seem to be as much in a whirl as is the rolling planet
which they inhabit.</p>

<p>This most unfortunate mental disease even disrupts
and destroys the much vaunted bonds of a
common religious faith.</p>

<p>On the planet Mars, aside from the Nazarranos,
another religious sect flourishes, founded by
a prophet whose name, as far as we could decipher,
was <small>MOE HAMID</small>. This <small>MOE HAMID</small> strictly prohibited
the use of the mussel as an article of nourishment.
And by the law of contradiction or by the
irony of fate, the sect has ever since been known as
the Musselmen. Now these Musselmen, although
dispersed among different nationalities, have really
formed a sort of brotherhood founded on their faith.
Whenever a holy war is declared in earnest, all
Musselmen stand together. That the members of
this sect should refer to the Nazarrano-Darvinianos
as dogs, may be deplorably one-sided, but can readily
be understood. At any rate the Musselmen are
known to stick together. Among the Darvinized
Nazarranos, however, cooperative brotherhood is
totally lacking. One of the Nazarrano-Darviniano
nations looks upon another such nation as a contemptible
pack of dogs; one nation considers the
other to be an aggregate of low barbarians; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
every single nation among them envies all the others
any political power or industrial prosperity which
by long-continued effort they may have attained.</p>

<p>Even though both <small>NAZARRO</small> and <small>DARVINO</small>
were fervent advocates of peace and tolerance, the
nations which are supposed to follow these two
Masters direct their best intelligence and scientific
accomplishments toward the invention of infernal
devices with which to maim and destroy one another.
Every new discovery made by scientific searchers is
at once seized upon for the purpose of making these
engines of torture ever more deadly, ever more maliciously
destructive. As he deciphered these words
one dreary night, Professor <small>FANSEE</small> whispered to
me in confidence that he had absolutely lost his belief
in the actual existence of Hell; but that this
revelation was making him reconsider his non-belief.
And, he added, if there is such a place, I am fully
convinced that, then, I have beyond doubt located
it on the planet Mars. Think of this insensate chaos
of low emotions, of this ceaseless courting of suffering,
death and devastation among nations which
should have formed a solid bond of friendship and
mutual respect, and which, had they done so, might
all have peaceably enjoyed all the wealth of the
Universe. And when you behold their primitive
lack of all kindly feeling, reflect that these nationality-maniacs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
are so utterly deluded as to bluntly call
themselves Nazarranos and to pray to the God of
<small>NAZARRO</small> for success in their wantonly destructive
pursuits!</p>

<p>Stirred to the depth by this display of unutterable
stupidity or seemingly hopeless irrationality,
we anxiously waited for further details. Little by
little, we subsequently succeeded in deciphering
them. It seems that among the antagonistic Nazarrano-Darviniano
nations there were two to whom
our Martian informer referred with particular emphasis.</p>

<p>One of these, inhabiting a country called Two-Tonia,
seems to be known to the Martians as the
<small>TWO-TONS</small>. Upon inquiry it was found that on
Mars the names by which the nations are known
are in some instances derived from their mental characteristics.
The Two-Tons have the reputation of
being mentally heavy. Each Two-Ton is supposed
to carry two tons of brain matter; and in many individual
cases this weight unfortunately becomes so
oppressive as to make them apparently incapable of
acquiring or developing the amiable and pliable mental
graces that adorn the minds of a few other nationalities.</p>

<p>The Two-Tons excel many other nations in
depth and scientific thoroughness. They have increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
their depth by digging very deep into any
subject to which they devote their attention. That
in their arguments in connection with the Darviniano
philosophy, aside from empirical pursuits, they are
apt to dig in the wrong direction, our Martian informer
promised to demonstrate. Digging as deep
as they do, one may easily understand, if they really
start digging in the wrong direction, how very far
from their philosophic object they are likely to wind
up in the end.</p>

<p>Among those nationalities whose national pride
stands in the way of an appreciation of the merits
of other nations, the Two-Tons must be counted
foremost. To them all other Nazarrano-Darviniano
nations seem utterly worthless and absurdly inferior.
For this reason they prefer occasional association
or alliance with the Musselmen, although
they are supposed to be praying to the Nazarrano
God, placing meanwhile their faith in the Darviniano
philosophy. Their contempt for other Nazarrano
nations knows no limit. They consider themselves
the creators and guardians of a special form
of civilization, endlessly superior to the degree of
mental growth reached in other countries. However
absurd and conceited this may seem, it must
at the same time be acknowledged that the brain-weight
of the Two-Tons has led to some remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
constructive results. In the short lapse of time of
forty years, making use of the material gathered in
earlier periods, they have succeeded in erecting a
palatial edifice of science and industry far exceeding
in excellence and unity of construction the many
isolated buildings erected for the same purpose in
the course of a few centuries in other countries.
How great and rich this nation could therefore have
grown, had they quietly fostered in their own hearts
their elation at their wonderful progress, and had
they not permitted contradictory delusions to mar
the solidity of their accomplishments!</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that among the products
which this nation was preparing with scientific care
was a dangerous explosive that was placed upon the
national market under the name of Militarism.
Every able-bodied male citizen was compelled to devote
a certain number of years to the manufacture
of this highly explosive product. As a consequence
there was such a superabundance of the stuff in
their country, that they decided to store barrels
upon barrels of it in the basement of their wonderfully
constructed edifice. Moreover, they placed a
fuse in every room and hall of the well-constructed
building, so that they might be in a position to blow
the whole structure up at a moment&#8217;s notice, apparently
just for spite, in case of a quarrel with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
other nation. Great engines were constructed of
precious metal from which this explosive was to
hurl huge balls, scientific stinkpots and other malicious
missiles into the ranks of the contemplated
enemy. And as these engines were wont to cough
up their deadly projectiles with an earsplitting noise,
the factory where the engines were produced was
facetiously referred to as the <small>CROUP</small>-factory. The
time indeed came when an explosion did occur, of
which the terrific results are as yet incapable of
compilation.</p>

<p>Another product of a very different kind, manufactured
by the Two-Tons, was mentioned by
our Martian informer, the real character of which
Professor <small>FANSEE</small> had some difficulty in deciphering.
At first the Professor translated its name as
Koaltar, but as the word was repeated, it proved
to be some sort of national talisman to which they
give the name of Kooltoor. The real meaning
of this word is still wrapped in mystery. It would
seem, however, that just as our word Culture refers
to the mental development of the individual, so is the
word Kooltoor used to denote the mental and physical
development of the Two-Ton nation as a whole.
I expect that Two-Tonia will be mentioned later in
Professor <small>FANSEE&#8217;S</small> manuscript in connection with
further international Martian events.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>The other nation most frequently mentioned by
our unseen communicant on Mars seems to be
known on that planet by the name of <small>ANGLERS-AXSONS</small>,
and was at other times referred to under
the name of <small>BRITS</small>. There is no doubt but that the
two names refer to the same nation, for in one instance
the word Axsons was left out, and our kind
Martian spoke distinctly of the Anglers or Brits.
They dwell apparently on a group of islands called
Anglia or Brittia. It further seems that one of these
islands is specifically known as the Ire-island, because
the ire of its inhabitants is so very easily
aroused. According to a legend, the nation of the
Brits was founded by a fisherman who drove the
snakes off the islands for the permanent protection
of the angleworms. This fisherman having been a
prehistoric patriarch, whose name has failed to come
down the sky-reaching slope of the centuries, the
nation is simply known as the Anglers. The ocean
has been the field of their conquests and the means
toward their development, which took about three
centuries, so that their national efforts commenced
some two centuries and a half before the Two-Tons
started theirs.</p>

<p>They are so wholeheartedly devoted to fishing,
it is said that during all this stretch of time they
continually have had their baited hooks ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
grab and appropriate anything to be found in, on
or near the ocean. They have not been unsuccessful
in their fishing enterprise. Sometimes they catch
fish. At other times they catch islands, coaling
stations, countries occupied by so-called inferior
tribes, a canal here and there built by the laborious
efforts of other nations; in fact they have gathered
all sorts of oceanic treasures whenever the other
nations failed to see them first. The surname
Ax-sons is probably derived from the fact that but a
few hundred years ago they were mere Skandalnavying
savages whose only weapon of offense and
defense was the battle-ax.</p>

<p>As to the name Brits, by which they seem in fact
to be most commonly known, it must be confessed
that Professor <small>FANSEE</small> had never succeeded in
discovering its intrinsic meaning. When I returned
to civilization, however, I decided to investigate;
and by carefully scanning all the dictionaries contained
in all the famous libraries of the Fidji Islands,
I discovered that the word Brit applies to a young
herring, once thought to be a distinct species. I
furthermore found that this word denotes the food
of the whalebone whales, consisting of small crustaceans,
pteropods (whatever that is), and other
minute surface swimming animals whose mammas
have cursed them with fancy names. It is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
that the Brits made at one time the fishing of brit
their national industry, and that they thus became
known by the name of the fish they sold, dished
up, and in other ways used for their own sel-fish
purposes. On the other hand it is equally plausible
that the name refers to their propensity of grabbing
little islands and coaling stations from the ocean,
just small enough to escape the attention of others
and to pass through the elastic dip-low-matic rake,
yet in the aggregate of sufficient bulk considerably
to increase their national weight and importance.</p>

<p>Speaking of dip-low-macy, the Brits are great
adepts at this low-dipping effort. It should be
known that in this peculiar Martian pursuit the
facial muscles are not permitted to betray the
schemes that are hatching in the brain. You think
and mean one thing, you say and appear to mean
something else. The heavy bulk of brain that burdens
the Two-Tons prevents these scientific people
from dissimulating their mental activity. They are
forced by nature to be blunt and candid, except
when they have caused some calamity and foxily
try to throw the blame on somebody else, as curiously
may be shown by subsequent events. But the
brains of the Brits are not quite so heavy. By
means of rowing, swimming, football, polo, golf,
tennis, cricket and other strenuous outdoor sports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
they have acquired perfect control over their
muscles. Especially is this ability apparent in their
clever manipulation of the muscles of the face.</p>

<p>At frequent occasions the Brits have covered
their angling activities with a veneer of apparently
noble purposes, so beautifully polished you could
almost use the veneer as a curved looking-glass.
For instance, when they were spreading their own
nationality all over the hilly surface of good old
Mars, their facial expression was extremely innocent
and noble while pretending merely to be spreading
the Nazarrano faith. While they did do their
share toward Nazarrizing the globe on which they
live, they did not, in accordance with the Nazarrano
precepts, look for their reward in heaven, but
they sold their virtues for cash and took their reward
by force of arms and dip-low-macy right on Mars
itself. Their plan was very simple. They would
send a missionary to spread the faith; subsequently
they would send him plenty of assistants. Then they
would start trading, always looking out&mdash;as tradesmen
should&mdash;for their own interests. This inevitably
led to disagreement with the natives. And as
the engines of destruction used by the unobtrusive
natives had not reached as high a phase of physical
civilization as had those of the Brits, all the latter
had to do at this phase of the game was to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
some of their own little destruction-machines to the
nation involved, and, after a little fighting, to make
the territory their own. They would then start to
colonize to clinch the one-sided deal.</p>

<p>To the development of science and industry
they also have contributed a very important share.
But as they believed in Culture and failed to develop
that national unity brought about by the Two-Ton
Kooltoor, their scientific and industrial buildings
have never as yet been combined into one great
edifice, such as so skilfully erected in Two-Tonia.
It is possible that the greater development of animal
spirits among the Brits <i>versus</i> the greater mental
momentum of the Two-Tons had something to do
with this difference in type of growth. It is possible
that it was simply due to the fact that the
minds of the great Brit thinkers and scientists had
developed in one direction, while those among the
Two-Tons had developed in a very different direction.
Yet there can be but little doubt but that one
of the most important causes of this divergency is
to be found in the circumstance that the Two-Tons
started to build their unified nation at a time when
the sciences had reached a high state of advancement,
and after a new philosophic sect had arisen among
the Two-Tons, who were popularly known as the
Social-Mists, and who laid particular stress on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
advantages of cooperation; while, on the contrary,
the foundation of the Brit institutions had been laid
during a period, when the development of modern
science had not given even its first signs of life.</p>

<p>In regard to the science of dip-low-macy, previously
referred to, it may here be stated that this
facial endeavor is by no means limited to the Brits
alone. It seems that this quasi-scientific deception
is practised with similar skill by other Martian
nations. And even allowing for the deplorable fact
that most of these nations are suffering from a pitiable
mental malady, it still is astounding to the
terrestrial onlooker that this ability to manipulate
the facial muscles is among the Martians regarded
as a highly meritorious attainment. Many dignitaries
of the Nazarrano corporation occupy high
places of honor on the strength of it. Nay, among
most of the Martian nations even the making and
the interpretation of the country&#8217;s laws is almost
exclusively entrusted to those who excel in this
deceitful pursuit. For the attainment to high political
office it seems to be an absolutely essential
accomplishment. Our Martian informer expressed
the fervent belief that, were it not for this irrational
and habitual deception, much of the petty malice
between nation and nation could have been avoided
or allayed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>We have heretofore found occasion to mention
that the national activity of the Brits covered a
period of some three hundred years, while that of
the Two-Tons was limited to a span of forty years.
This apparent difference in national duration is due
to the fact that for many years up to the year 11
E.D. (1871 E.N.) the Two-Tons had been divided
into a number of small principalities, each leading a
semi-national existence of its own. In the year mentioned,
after a destruction-chief by the name of
<small>MOULD-KEY</small> had conquered the Frank-Aulians
popularly known as the Fringe, a Two-Ton leader
called <small>BEES&#8217;MARK</small>, because he left the mark of a
very busy bee upon Two-Tonia, united the principalities
into one great Two-Ton empire. Two chiefs
reigned for a short time over the new-born nation,
and then were succeeded by another ruler, a man of
strenuous activity, bearing the high-sounding name
of <small>WILMOSTASH</small>. This man seems to have had
a prominent influence on the Two-Tonian growth;
and the Two-Tons are convinced that their natural
development is in essence due to the tireless efforts
of this ruler, whose facial adornments indeed reach
up toward the distant heavens.</p>

<p>The industrial preparations among the Two-Ton
principalities previous to their federation, were
now by the Two-Tons regarded as of but little consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Especially the younger generations saw
naught but the growth of the united nation since
the year 11 E.D. (1871 E.N.). And when they
realized that they occupied an industrial position
on the planet Mars at least as important as that of
any other nation, they were impressed with the idea
that in three, four decades they had accomplished
what had taken other nations three, four centuries
to reach. This impression could not but vastly increase
their national pride, so that the nationality-mania,
so common among the deluded Martians,
was in Two-Tonia brought to an acute phase, overshadowing
in depth and seriousness the similar
mental malady prevalent among other nations.</p>

<p>As a consequence, as they gradually attained
their important industrial position, they aspired at
a political position of similar importance. But being&mdash;as
a consequence of their brain-weight&mdash;less
nimble and more blunt than many of the other
races, they frequently assumed in the counsel of
nations a high-toned attitude which the others looked
upon as arrogant, and by force of which they frequently
attempted to dictate the final decisions on
international problems.</p>

<p>Had the nations not been deluded by their antagonistic
and ever suspicious nationality-mania, they
would have reasoned with the Two-Tons, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
would have endeavored better to understand their
ideals and their motives, and they might have learned
much from them, just as the Two-Tons themselves
in earlier years had learned a great deal from the
others. But as a consequence of the deplorable
Martian delusion, this attitude on the part of the
Two-Tons had the effect of emphasizing all the
more the malice that one nation bore another, and
even resulted in a combination of the ill-will of
various otherwise mutually unfriendly nations, in
aggregate directed against the Two-Tons. As the
neighboring nations watched with anxiety the profuse
production of the militaristic explosive in the
Two-Tonian empire, and as they scented an imminent
danger of an explosion, they&mdash;by means of
combinations and alliances&mdash;commenced to take measures
to protect themselves against the Two-Tonian
aggression which, they thought, was bound sooner
or later to change from a merely mental attitude
into a series of acts of physical violence. Among
the nations so combined, special mention should be
made of the <small>FRANK-AULIANS</small> or <small>FRINGE</small>, who, besides
watching with suspicion the growing militaristic
activity of their neighbor, were moreover animated
by their desire to obtain redress for the damage
done them in 1871 E.N., when they lost the territories
of All-Sass and Low-Rain to the Two-Tons.
Indeed, though this desire&mdash;at first vehemently proclaimed&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
largely diminished in fervor as time
wore on, still it was one of the undercurrents conscientiously
to be taken into account in the judgment
one might attempt to pass upon later developments.
In the anti-Two-Tonian protective combinations, the
Fringe no doubt figured prominently.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the primitive condition
of Martian civilization that a nation&#8217;s political influence
is determined, not by the wisdom it displays
in international counsel, but by the size of
the territory it controls, and partly, therefore, by the
extent of its colonies. Now, during three long centuries
various nations had explored the oceans and
snapped up all the territories fit for colonization;
and owing to the successful angling of the Brits,
many of these colonies had in the end fallen into
their hands. Next in colonial possessions came the
Fringe, and another nation known as the Whole-landers
also controlled considerable outlying territory.
But as all these nations had been engaged
in this accumulation-process for so long a span of
time, the Two-Tons, when they commenced to
search for similar far-off fields of expansion, found
but little left over. And not being as perfect in dip-low-matic
attainments as other nations, the Two-Tons,
as other nations had feared all along, came
to the conclusion that the only way in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
could attain to the same type of political influence,
was by force of arms, in other words, by
a free and very inconsiderate use of their national
explosive on other nations&#8217; territories. I am here
tempted to call attention to the marked influence
which political conditions exert over the mental
activity of a nation&#8217;s philosophic authors.</p>

<p>This temptation is so great that I shall overcome
my reluctance, and reveal what our Martian
communicant secretly confided to Professor <small>FANSEE</small>
one memorable night, when both were looking
for relaxation from the strain of their protracted
labor. On this indeed very rare occasion our
Martian philosopher confided to Professor <small>FANSEE</small>
some of his own personal earlier experiences. From
these it appeared that the Martian&mdash;I picture him
in my imagination as a tall, lean man with a long
white beard&mdash;had originally been a fervent follower
of the faith of <small>NAZARRO</small>, and that afterwards he
had been converted to Darvinianoism. And so profoundly
had the Darviniano conclusions obtained a
hold on his mentality, that he finally refused to look
upon the Heebron and Nazarrano manuscripts as
in any way authoritative in regard to what did and
what did not constitute morality. With my deeper
understanding of Nature, he then had said to himself,
let me go back to her, and Nature herself shall teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
me the laws of proper conduct. But when he had
commenced conscientiously to observe the methods
of Nature with this purpose in view, he soon discovered
that the conduct of Nature as a whole
greatly differs from the conduct deemed just and
proper by the Martians. He found that Nature may
at any time produce an upheaval of the soil, by
which libraries, printing-presses, art museums, temples,
churches, factories, institutes of industry and
learning, would in a few hours be wantonly destroyed,
without the slightest discrimination between
the criminal and the virtuous, between things
evil and things beneficial to the Martians. In this
then, he mused, we cannot follow Nature.</p>

<p>Then, seeking for better guidance, he had bethought
himself of the law of the survival of the
fittest. This law, he reflected, we may be able
consciously to apply to our conduct. But how? It
is evident that this law refers essentially to physical
impediments and obstructions, to physical conditions
only. An icy blast may sweep the top of a
high hill and wipe out the tribe that inhabits it, and
those living in the valley may survive. Yet, had
those in the valley been at the pinnacle, they would
have perished, and had those at the pinnacle lived
in the valley, they would in turn have survived.
And if one were to ask what would have happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
had the blast struck both tribes at the same time,
we answer, those physically the fittest would have
survived, absolutely independent of their virtues or
vices or of the degree of their intelligence.</p>

<p>Has intelligence then been of no consequence
whatever in the activity of this law? Does not the
fact that an intelligent race has survived races of
animals physically far more ferocious furnish proof
positive of the influence of intelligence on the operation
of the great law? No, had the Martian concluded,
it furnishes no such proof whatever. An
intelligent race has survived, not in consequence of
the physical law of survival, but in opposition to it.
It survived because it devised means of protection
wherewith to oppose the indiscriminating physical
forces by which survival had theretofore been determined.
And when one compares the individual
members of that intelligent race with one another,
one soon discovers that those of superior intelligence
are often physically far more frail than are
the dull-minded specimens, and hence frequently
far less fit to withstand the onslaught of antagonistic
physical forces.</p>

<p>Do we seek to apply this much quoted law of
survival to morality, we find to our dismay that not
infrequently the unscrupulous thief and deceiver
and the blunt bully grow and prosper, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
honest and virtuous thinker, less tricky or less self-assertive,
is the unfortunate and suffering underdog.
Of course, if this law of survival were indeed
to be applied to our international views, we could
only praise and admire those who have acquired
power: we certainly would have no good cause to
hate them.</p>

<p>We shall soon discover that the Martian spoke
in detail on this subject to Professor <small>FANSEE</small>,
because it had an important bearing upon the further
political events on Mars. And it may therefore
be proper for me, also to quote to what conclusion
the Martian philosopher came at the end of his revelations.</p>

<p>Would anyone think, he exclaimed, of trying to
advocate the law of gravitation as a guide to proper
conduct? No one would, because it would be utterly
absurd. For no Martian can add one iota to its
power or take away one iota from its everlasting
activity by conscious effort. We can add to or
subtract from it no more than we could add to or
subtract from the material of which our Universe is
composed. And just as little good or bad as our
conscious scheming can do to the law of gravitation,
just as little can it aid or hamper the law of
the survival of the fittest, except in so far as we may
be able to protect ourselves against its indiscriminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
lack of consideration. That law has ruled long before
there was any self-consciousness, long before
there was intelligence in the living entities, long
before one group of specimens of a deluded species
envied another group its industrial or political importance.
If life were to be ruled by this law, it
would be absurd to devise remedies against epidemics.
In that case, we should allow the disease to
ravage the nation all it wants to. Nature would
thus render the Martians a special favor by destroying
those unfit to survive that particular disease.
And after epidemic Number One had passed, we
might allow some new epidemic to destroy all the
survivors, even though among those killed by the
first disease there might have been many who could
successfully have survived epidemic Number Two,
had they only still been alive to face it.</p>

<p>The absurdity of the proposition of being
guided by this automatic law had, therefore, become
plainly apparent to our Martian philosopher. And
then it was, he told Professor <small>FANSEE</small>, that he began
to realize the truth of what had been said by others,
that the moral precepts contained in the Heebron
and Nazarrano manuscripts had sprung from the
verdicts of human reason, after many centuries of
experience and observation of social requirements;
and that they had become obnoxious to certain Darvinianos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
not because they were in themselves wrong
or misleading, but because they had until now always
been imparted as if inseparably founded on
a devoted faith in personal semi-human Deities.
Separate them from that ancient faith, and they are
strong enough in themselves to remain standing,
fastened deep into the rock of human experience, as
efficient guide-posts on the road that leads through
the labyrinth of life. As experience erected them,
experience may perhaps later still further improve
them. Not your experience alone, or my experience
alone, but the experience of all the Martians combined,
scientifically founded on the decrees of further
advanced logic.</p>

<p>After this relaxation by way of a heart-to-heart
confession, our noble Martian returned to his narrative
of the struggling nations, and here he showed
at once in what way his confession was connected
with his interesting little chapter of political history.</p>

<p>The Two-Ton philosophers, he said, like himself
profoundly impressed with the Darviniano faith,
had commenced to look to the laws of Nature for
moral guidance. And having started to dig in this
direction, the momentum of their brain-weight prevented
them from changing their course. Thus it
came about that <small>NEETCH-UR</small>, a philosopher of note
in Two-Tonia, utterly cast aside all Nazarrano precepts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Why cure, protect or aid the weak? Let the
strong survive as Nature naturally would let them.
Will they be less intelligent? Blame Nature. Will
they be less considerate of their brothers&#8217; well-being?
It&#8217;s the fault of Nature who then apparently
wanted it that way. What <small>NEETCH-UR</small> taught,
therefore, was the moral excellence of physical and
mental power, inconsiderately overriding all those
whose powers are less mighty, even if this &#8220;moral&#8221;
attitude should lead the Martians to a condition of
total im-morality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neetch-ur</span> was an oratorical author productive
of high-sounding maxims, who never endeavored
to test their efficiency by the road of logic. Though
his ideals were evidently floating in the wrong direction,
he nevertheless had some of the marks of the
genius. Nationality was to him a minor consideration.
He addressed his advocacy of the rule of the
powerful to all the inhabitants of Mars, and if a
Brit or a Skandalnavying were more powerful than a
Two-Ton, he would have witnessed with satisfaction
the Two-Ton&#8217;s overthrow by the Brit or the sturdy
Skandalnavying.</p>

<p>To the Two-Tons, influenced as they were by
the Martian nationality-mania, this view of life was
a bit too broad. The correctness of the nature-view
was not questioned. Especially not since one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
their most renowned empirical scientists, known as
Professor <small>HECKLER</small>, had boldly toddled from his
empirical laboratory into the field of philosophy, and
had strenuously emphasized the nature-view, with
utter neglect of the emotional side of the Martian
character. But though the nature-view was held to
be perfectly in order, <small>NEETCH-UR&#8217;S</small> international
broadness did not coincide with the Two-Tonian
national mental tendencies. No wonder, therefore,
that another author soon arose, named <small>TRITE-SHKUR</small>,
who adopted <small>NEETCH-UR&#8217;S</small> views, but
applied them exclusively to the glory of the Two-Tons.
If any one nation was to survive by its
power to conquer, that one nation must be the
nation of the Two-Tonians. The Brits with their
propensity toward territorial expansion had ruled
the misty planet long enough. We, the Two-Tons,
have a greater quantity of explosives than have the
Brits. Our Kooltoor is far greater than their culture.
The God of <small>NAZARRO</small>, no matter what precepts
<small>NAZARRO</small> himself may have proclaimed, will
take joy in seeing us conquer. We must go for the
Brits, use our explosives indiscriminately, and thus
capture all the territory we can, in order to force
the law of survival to make its decision in our favor.</p>

<p>And when his writings were followed by another
book compiled by an explosive-manufacturer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
suitably named <small>BURN-ARDOR</small>, and which described
in detail the method to be followed in the
contemplated struggle, the minds of the Two-Tons
were fully made up concerning the futility of Nazarrano
kindness, and the superiority of nature-morality.
Indeed, when the struggle came, even the
Two-Ton division of the Social-Mist sect, advocates
of international cooperation and peace, compounders
of a cure for the dreadful nationality-mania,
prophets of good-will to all nations, but among
whom the nature-view nevertheless largely prevailed,
suddenly lost their idealistic enthusiasm, and
joined the ranks of the nationality-maniacs, in order
to make use of the explosives under the command of
the destruction-chiefs. Had these Social-Mists suddenly
gone mad? Why no, not suddenly. They
simply felt their intimate relationship to one of the
Martian nations; and these nations had been mad
for centuries, and had not yet been brought back
to sanity; that&#8217;s all.</p>

<p>True, in other countries the Darviniano philosophy
had led to conclusions of a different type.
In Brittia a contemporary of <small>DARVINO</small>, answering
to the name of <small>SPENSAIRO</small>, had elaborately traced
the development of Martian social conditions from
time immemorial to date. And he showed that as
the nations had advanced in civilization, their pursuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and mental attitude had grown more and more
peaceable. He concluded that the martial spirit of
destruction is a spirit of barbaric savagery. Hence,
cooperation among the various nations for the good
of all was the ideal toward which his conclusions
pointed. It is curious that this advocate of peace
arose in a country that had arrived at a position of
foremost political importance, so that by this nation
no struggle for predominance with other nations was
in the least desired. It is just as curious that in
Two-Tonia, which was actually engaged in a mental
struggle for supremacy, the rising philosophers were
advocates of the sanctity of power and the primordial
struggle for survival.</p>

<p>Indeed, the militaristic <small>BURN-ARDOR</small> previously
referred to, sarcastically pointed to this influence
of political conditions upon a nation&#8217;s philosophic
views. He expressed the opinion that these philosophers
purposely proclaimed their conclusions for
the benefit of their own country. Our Martian informer,
however, thought that it was simply one of
the subconscious elements that unwittingly influence
the thoughts of a nation and of its authors. As
<small>BURN-ARDOR</small> saw in this wholly unavoidable result
the effect of nefarious deep-low-matic selfishness,
he even declared that, as between nation and nation,
neither virtue, nor honor, nor fairness was ever taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
in consideration. Yet, if it is bad for the members of
a family to treat one another without fair-minded
loyalty, if it is morally despicable for any family to
treat the neighboring families dishonorably and with
malice or hidden unfair purposes, it is just as contemptible
for that larger aggregate of Martians,
called a nation, to treat any other nation unfairly or
unscrupulously. <small>BURN-ARDOR</small> probably gave his
impression of things as he thought they were, and
not as he thought they ought to be.</p>

<p>When the <small>TWO-TONIAN SUPREMACY WAR</small>
had at last become a dreadful physical fact, a number
of nations were involved in the titanic struggle.
Considering the jealousy with which the Brits
had long guarded their predominance, and the
Two-Ton aspiration to supplant them, one might
have expected the Two-Tons to seek some deep-low-matic
excuse for engaging the Brits in a gigantic
wrestling match. And had they done so, the Martian
world would probably have looked on, impartial,
and satisfied to see the best man win. But the
struggle was brought about in a very different manner.</p>

<p>One nation, in reality the only one with whom
the Two-Tons entertained intimate relations, was the
group of Martians usually referred to as the Ostrich-ans
or <small>AUSTRICH-ANS</small>. They were so named, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
because the ostrich makes their country its habitat,
for this bird never had any such intention; not because
they were wont, like the ostrich, to hide their
heads in the sand under the impression that they are
thus protected from an approaching enemy, for when
they are compelled to hide, they are wise enough
not to hide their heads alone and leave the rest of
their frail bodies exposed: the name Austrich-ans
was given them because, like this famous bird, they
were known for a voracious and very varied appetite.
They were in the habit of nibbling, whenever
they had a chance, at the neighboring territories
known as the Bally-Khan States. They had even
at one time dipped their steel forks into the plate
of the <small>EAT-ALL-IANS</small>, a nation whose territory also
borders theirs. Nay, so typically were they renowned
for their everlasting appetite, that one prominent
part of their country actually bears the official
name <small>HUNG&#8217;RY</small>! As the Two-Tons are reputed to
serve five meals a day, and as the Austrich-ans
moreover speak the same language as the Two-Tons,
the friendship between these two nations was ideal,
and even caused them to dream of a delicious Pan-Two-Tonianism.</p>

<p>The nearest neighbors of these Austrich-ans
were a much smaller tribe which subsequently was
referred to as the <small>SERVERS</small>, because they served the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Two-Tons apparently as a welcome excuse to start
the struggle. The Austrich-ans had no end of
trouble with the Servers. The nationality-mania
between them had indeed developed to a state of
very dangerous acuteness. At last, in the country
of the Servers, a crime was committed of which an
Austrich-an official was the victim. Now in the
Darvinized Nazarrano countries all crimes were
dealt with by law-courts instituted for this very
purpose. And in case a foreigner was the victim,
the courts were wont to act with redoubled vigor;
and the country where the deed had been done
would moreover make amends to the country of
which the victim had been a citizen, amends which
were made in various forms. Law-courts, in fact,
are one of the first marks of civilization on Mars.
But the Austrich-ans were not satisfied to treat this
particular case in the ordinary legal way. They
sent the Servers a message demanding such amends
as no nation had ever demanded of any other.
Their message of indignation was couched in terms,
and contained stipulations, to which no self-respecting
nation, not even the smallest, could in the eyes
of the rest of the Martian world honorably have
submitted.</p>

<p>Now the Servers were one of a group of small
nations, heretofore referred to as the Bally-Khan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
States, and they had a powerful friend and protector
in the politically far more important nation of the
<small>RUSH-NOTS</small>. The Rush-Nots were named for the
slowness of their national progress. For many centuries
there had been among the Nazarrano nations
a pronounced prejudice against the Heebrons, notwithstanding
the fact that <small>NAZARRO</small> Himself had
been a Heebron and had followed the Heebron faith.
Heebrons were unscrupulously persecuted, robbed,
tortured, murdered, their possessions frequently confiscated,
and they were permitted to dwell only in
special sections set aside for them. These criminal
proceedings had long ago been abolished in all the
other Nazarrano countries, but the Rush-Nots continued
to indulge in these sordid amusements of the
long-forgotten past. In all other Nazarrano countries,
moreover, the power of the ruler had been
limited by giving his subjects a share in determining
the laws that govern them. Among the Rush-Nots
the ruler still had absolute power over his subjects
as the rulers in other countries had had in the long-forgotten
past. So you can easily understand that
in matters of progress and social improvement they
rushed not. Nevertheless, by means of bloodshed,
the Rush-Nots had acquired a goodly proportion of
the crust of Mars. So the Rush-Nots, being friends
of the Bally-Khan nations to which group the Servers
belonged, parleyed with the Austrich-ans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
told them to treat the Servers more politely, and
threatened that otherwise they would be compelled
to direct their engines of destruction very impolitely
against the Austrich-ans.</p>

<p>We have stated before that Brittia was desirous
of permanent peace. So, indeed, were the
Rush-Nots, because they, too, had obtained more
than their due proportion of Martian territory. So,
too, were the previously mentioned Frank-Aulians
or Fringe, who in fact had entered into an intimate
bond of friendship with the Rush-Nots. The Brits
therefore, to all appearances, did their best by means
of dip-low-macy to avoid the threatening war. But
the Austrich-ans hurriedly commenced to make war
preparations; and when the Rush-Nots saw this,
they followed suit.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Austrich-ans had acted all
this time with the secret approval of the great
<small>WILMOSTASH</small>, or the Two-Ton explosive-manufacturers,
may forever be a question fit for debate.
Yet so much is certain that, at this momentous stage
of the international quarrel, <small>WILMOSTASH</small> peremptorily
told the Rush-Nots to turn their destructive
apparatus back from the Austrich-an borders,
so that Austricha might do to the Servers
whatever served the Austrich-an-Two-Tonian interests
best. The Rush-Nots told the mighty <small>WILMOSTASH</small><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to go to Halifax, a sort of meeting-place
where it is always hot to suffocation.</p>

<p>Did the Two-Tons thereupon at once attack
the Rush-Nots? No, they Did-not. Aware that the
Fringe were an important factor in various anti-Two-Tonian
protective alliances, they anticipated
that the Fringe would beyond question actively side
with the Rush-Nots. As a consequence, you might
have expected the Two-Tons to start a vigorous
campaign against the Rush-Nots, meanwhile heavily
guarding their borders against invasion by the
Fringe. And in case the Fringe would subsequently
have grown too gay, the Two-Tons might then
justly have handled them in accordance with the
rules dominating such international pastimes. As
their quarrel was with the Rush-Nots, this of course
would to all appearances have been the logical plan
to follow. Yet, even this plainly outlined course
the Two-Tons Did-not take. Under the impression
that the Rush-Not armies are heavy and slow, and
that the Fringe are light and quick as lightning;
convinced moreover that their chances of victory lay
in offensive action, and that a defensive attitude
might imperil their cause, the Two-Tons decided,
before assailing the Rush-Nots, first to attack the
Fringe.</p>

<p>In explanation of the odd-sounding name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the latter nation, let me state that the Frank-Aulians
or Fringe are named for the frankness with
which they own and exhibit their vices as well as
their virtues. Aulians is sometimes spelled Owlians
and evidently refers to the fact that many of their
great men are known to have been night-owls. The
shorter name Fringe is applied to them on account
of their artistic inclinations. Although they have
contributed a goodly share to Martian science, philosophy
and the industries, their most pronounced
characteristic is that they are so eminently fond of
profuse decoration. They decorate their homes,
their theatres, their churches, and their minds.
Thus they have decorated the Nazarrano-Darviniano
form of civilization with a harmoniously colored
fringe of politeness, a bit fuzzy, quite a bit inclined
toward dip-low-matic deceit, but, all in all, rather
artistic.</p>

<p>When the Two-Tons had decided to attack the
Fringe, did they cross that part of their border that
leads directly into the Fringe territory? No, they
Did-not. By George, king of the Brits, I am almost
inclined hereafter to call the Two-Tons the Did-Nots!
Instead of this, they decided to run their destructive
engines across two small and perfectly
nootril countries, one known as Luxury-burgh, and
the other inhabited by a valiant little nation whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
name is fast going down in Martian history as the
<small>BELL-GIANTS</small>. Their country contains all sorts of
beautiful old buildings and churches renowned all
over Mars for their marvelous bells and chimes; and
small as be their number, they are, nevertheless,
known as the Giants, because in case of need they
are willing to undertake gigantic tasks, from which
many another small nation would shrink in fear.
Accordingly, the Bell-Giants obstructed the passage
of the Two-Tons, and undertook a struggle in which
they were bound to be defeated.</p>

<p>And here comes a typical instance of Brit deep-low-macy.
Because the maniacal envy of nation
toward nation had become unbearable even to the
deluded Martians, the nations had signed certain
agreements for the protection of what was called
the buffer-countries, territories whose neutrality was
to be respected in case the bigger nations would
ever go to war. The Two-Tons had signed this
agreement, and so had the Brits. Now after the
Brits had endeavored to prevent the war, they published
the letters and telegrams which they had exchanged
for that purpose with the various foreign
dip-low-mats. From this correspondence it appears
that the Two-Tons had made an inquiry to find out
whether the Brits would look on unmoved or
whether they would take a hand in the upheaval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in case the Two-Tons were to start the international
cataclasm. In reply, the Brits carefully controlled
their muscles and said, they were not at all certain
what they would do. May-be they were at first indeed
undecided. But then one of the Brit dip-low-mats
asked one of the medal-bearing chesty Two-Tons
whether Two-Tonia would agree not to annex
any part of the Fringe territory. The Two-Ton
replied that Two-Tonia would positively refrain
from any such glaring violation of the Nazarrano
precepts. Whereupon the Brit, who in the meantime
had telegraphed to his government, returned
to the weighty Two-Ton to ask whether his promise
also held good for the Fringe <i>colonies</i>. The Two-Ton
smilingly remarked that even <small>NAZARRO</small>
Himself could not expect the virtue of the Two-Tons
to carry them so far as to stoop to so absurd
a self-abnegation. And as the Brits were not
anxious to have a colonial competitor with habits
so deep-digging as those of the Two-Tons, the Brits
undoubtedly made up their minds then and there
not to look on unmoved. So when the Two-Tons
started to cross the territory of the Bell-Giants and
forced them to a hopeless self-defense, the Brits
rose in ire and made a noisy hallabaloo about the
violation of the neutrality treaty, and used this as
an excuse to join the opponents of the Two-Tons.
Thus once again, they hid their selfishness behind a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
rather transparent veneer of noble indignation and
ideals.</p>

<p>And now the war is on, and an insensate pandemonium
reigns in the countries which we once
looked upon as civilized. An amount of energy is
being wasted that, if properly applied, could have
led to the realization of many a wonderful social
ideal, many a hope long cherished by humanity in
vain. An amount of wealth is being squandered on
destruction which, applied in conjunction with this
vast amount of energy, could have built castles of
education beyond our present dreams, institutes of
mind-broadening influence upon all the suffering
human race. An amount of blood and life is being
sacrificed, compared to which the human sacrifices
to the gods of yore dwindle into utter insignificance.
And all this for the vain-glory that some one nation
might harvest, by wantonly destroying the pride of
existence, the happiness, the strength, the life-blood
of another. What the outcome of this blind folly
will be, no one, alas, as yet can tell.</p>

<p>Here came once more a pause of silence, and
the Martian philosopher thereupon entrusted to
Professor <small>FANSEE</small> some further personal confidences.
The country I live in, he said, was discovered by an
enterprising traveler for whom many statues have
been erected and who is therefore popularly referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to as <small>COLUMN-BUST</small>. When he discovered our
country he exclaimed &#8220;Eureka!&#8221; which means in
one of the dead Martian languages: I have found it.
As a result of this exclamation, my country was
called <small>AM-EUREKA</small>. I may say with pride, and
with a humane lack of prejudice entirely uninfluenced
by the usual nationality-mania, that my country
is one of the few on Mars in which petty jealousy
and malice against other nations is totally unknown.
Although the Nazarrano and Darviniano
faiths form a mechanical mixture among us just as
among other civilized nations, yet the Heebron and
Nazarrano precepts are beyond all else dear to us;
not so much for their supposedly divine origin, but
far more so for their humane and beneficent character.
We are not double-faced, either nationally or
internationally. In the conduct of business as well
as in our international relations we are broadminded.
When we say we are in favor of permanent peace,
we mean what we say, without hiding any selfish
motives. When we say we are, if need be, ready
to fight for a noble cause, there is nothing in our
minds except this noble cause, and we have no by-thoughts
to hide.</p>

<p>Now I was born on that hemisphere on which
the struggle is now going on, and to which we in
Am-Eureka, owing to our strictly neutral principles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
nowadays refer as <small>YOUR-ROPE</small>. Am-Eureka became
my country by adoption; and in Your-Rope I
had frequented artistic circles from which I imbibed
exceedingly lofty ideals, such as Art for Art&#8217;s
sake, Science for the sake of Science, the preference
of other aims to money-hunting, and so on. And not
finding similar ideals catered to in my adopted country,
I personally had always considered the inhabitants
of Your-Rope as on a plane of civilization far
higher than that reached in Am-Eureka.</p>

<p>The drama at present being played in that
hemisphere of so-called high ideals has absolutely
changed this point of view. The simple precepts of
<small>NAZARRO</small> and of the earlier Heebron teachers are
the best that the Martians can desire for their
guidance. The brotherhood of nations and the
peaceable attitude of man toward man no matter
on what part of Mars he happens to have been born,
is an ideal at least as inspiring as Art for Art&#8217;s sake.
The high flying and loudly proclaimed ideals of
Your-Rope are not the ideals of humanity at large.
They are fitted for but a small class of men who
by these ideals are inspired toward producing things
of wonderful beauty, highly idealistic, but utterly
superfluous to human comfort and welfare. The
peace-ideal of the Am-Eurekans, unobtrusive, subconsciously
active in their heart and every-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
actions, not claiming a sky-reaching mental superiority,
is not only fit for all Martians, young and
old, high and low, able and unable, hence also for
those engaged in the production of useful things
needed in every-day life, but it is moreover an ideal
which would benefit all civilized countries and aid
the further development of science, industry, and
mental as well as physical civilization.</p>

<p>Here the Martian philosopher seemed to have
been interrupted. A few minutes elapsed before the
Zee-rays continued to do their interesting work. My
assistant remarks, he subsequently said, that Am-Eureka
itself but recently might have gone to war
with a neighboring country called <small>MAKE-SICK-O</small>, and
that the Am-Eurekans actually sent a fleet to <small>WE&#8217;RE-ON-A-CRUISE</small>.
And indeed, such things may sometimes
be necessary. But our behavior in We&#8217;re-on-a-Cruise
is typical of the difference between Am-Eurekan
and Your-Ropean warfare. When we
Am-Eurekans entered We&#8217;re-on-a-Cruise, there were
snipers there who shot at us from windows and housetops.
One must expect these things on a campaign
of invasion. The private citizens naturally are your
enemies as much as are the uniformed soldiers. So,
what did we do? We shot back at them whenever
it was unavoidable. Whenever possible, we arrested
them. We further saw to it that all citizens surrendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
all weapons in their possession. This work
done, we started to improve the sanitary conditions
of the town. We made the town more comfortable
to live in than it had ever been under Make-sickan
rule. On the other hand, it is said of the Two-Tons
that they conquered among others a town called
Low-Vein situated in the territory of the Bell-Giants.
Quite naturally they found snipers there. Did they
meet the situation as humanely as we had done?
No, they Did-not. So passionately enraged were
they, on the contrary, at this inevitable discovery,
that they burned, shelled, and destroyed the larger
part of the town and its inhabitants; and a town this
in which the very buildings were treasures of mediaeval
art. After this, further sanitary improvements
were almost wholly superfluous.</p>

<p>No, even though circumstances may have compelled
us to send that fleet, even though similar circumstances
may again compel us to similar acts, and
even though we may thus find ourselves some day
engaged in bloody war with some other nation, in
our minds and in our breasts we bear no malice toward
either the Make-sickans or any other nation
on all our vast planet. We might fight, but the fight
having been fought, we would gladly shake hands,
and feel sincerely sorry that we had been drawn
into a nasty quarrel. And this, without dip-low-macy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
without manipulation of the facial muscles,
wholeheartedly, as befits a good sport.</p>

<p>Separated as we are, by an expansive ocean,
from the main seat of nationality-mania, we look on
unprejudiced, pitying deeply the Martians who are
forced to suffer by its fearful consequences, and doing
what we can to stay at least the starvation that
might follow in the struggle&#8217;s dreadful wake.</p>

<p>Nor do we take sides in this horrible calamity.
Why call one madman a fool and jolly the other
madman by telling him that he is right? We, on
this side of the rocking pond, do not care a rap
whether the Brits, the Two-Tons, or any other nation
attains to world-supremacy, provided that, this
supremacy reached, they shall not assume an overbearing
attitude or dictate to us how we are to conduct
our business. We Am-Eurekans do not aspire
at supremacy. Our institutions are founded on
equality; and, indeed, equality and supremacy cannot
easily be made to harmonize. All we aspire to
attain is what a clean-minded and healthful development
of our resources and intelligence may bring us
in the natural course of events. All we advise other
nations is to be wise enough not maliciously to interfere
with this development.</p>

<p>Did the Two-Tons believe the Brits were maliciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
interfering with their natural growth? Then
they should have gone straight for the Brits, without
starting a campaign against the Fringe or the
Rush-Nots, and without a destructive passage
through a small country that never had been accused
of malicious interference. Were the Brits
under the impression that their natural development
was maliciously interfered with by the Two-Tons?
Then they should have settled their quarrel openly
and directly with the Two-Tons, without waiting
deep-low-matically for a &#8220;noble&#8221; excuse that they
all along expected to be furnished them. We Am-Eurekans
believe in a fair fight when a fight cannot
be avoided; stripped and without gloves if need be;
but no hitting below the belt.</p>

<p>When the war broke out, we in Am-Eureka
noticed that the actual hostilities had been started
by the Two-Tons. We noticed that, instead of limiting
their activities to assailing the nation they were
about to attack, they forced their way through other
countries, one of these being the land of the Bell-Giants,
against the Bell-Giants&#8217; clearly expressed
desire to the contrary. The Bell-Giants were defending
naught but their right to keep aloof from
the mad struggle; and when, owing to the narrow
limits of their territory and resources, they were defeated,
their fields devastated and their towns destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
we naturally sympathized with the Bell-Giants
in their pitiable plight. There are Two-Tons
who migrated to my adopted country but who are
still in close sympathy with the Two-Tonian nationality-mania,
and who saw in this attitude on our part
the evidence of ill-will against Two-Tonia. Yet before
these grim events no sign of any such ill-will or
hatred had ever been detected. Nor will it be possible
to detect any after the struggle for supremacy
shall have come to an end. We in Am-Eureka
love justice, and justice necessarily involves a deep-seated
consideration for the rights of others, and a
systematic avoidance of any passionate violence,
especially of violence in the wrong direction. But
the Two-Tons may be at ease. Our sympathies are
not with the backward Rush-Nots or with the deep-low-matic
Brits, either. Were they to indulge in
unjust acts, we would detest these acts as definitely
in them as in any other Martians. Only, while we
may disapprove of an act of injustice in any nation,
that does not mean that we bear malice toward the
nation as such, nor that we fail to appreciate whatever
virtue or wisdom that nation may possess.</p>

<p>After thus having described the attitude of his
own country, the Martian philosopher declared that
this was in reality not the main purpose of his reflections.
What he wished to emphasize was, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
said, that the whole deplorable conflict could have
been avoided if only the Martian nations had taken
measures to cure, at least in part, the nationality-mania
that at any time is likely blindly to arouse
their destructive passions. To you, he said, at the
distance at which you see our planet, all of our
globe must make the impression of an insane asylum,
where nationality-mania and nationalized megalomania
are the two mental aberrations most prominently
prevalent. But in reality, he assured us, these
people are not insane. They are simply deluded,
carried away by a wrong and intensely harmful conception
of honor and of Martian greatness.</p>

<p>My most intense hope is, continued the Martian
philosopher, that by proper mental training we may
be enabled to re-direct their quasi-noble impulses
into better and more constructive channels. As I
contemplate the struggling armies, I see their banners
raised high above the surging regiments. But
I see the national colors dimmed with powder-smoke
and the dust of the battle, so that now the banners
look all alike to me; and over the smutty surface
of every one of them, I see the word <small>FOLLY</small> glaring
in the vivid red of warm young blood. How
much better will it be to see in the near future the
same banners, the national marks of distinction dimmed
by factory smoke and the dust of the quarries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and to see written on all of them in letters of gold:
<small>FOR THE FEDERATION AND WELL-BEING OF HUMANITY;
PEACE AND GOOD-WILL TO ALL MEN OF
ALL NATIONS</small>.</p>

<p>At this moment Professor <small>FANSEE</small> bethought
himself of a question that he had all along intended
to put to the Martian philosopher, but that had so
far been crowded out by the Martian&#8217;s interesting
narrative. &#8220;For what purpose,&#8221; he finally asked,
&#8220;did you Martians construct those straight-lined
canals that cross your planet?&#8221; Came from the
Martian the counter-question: &#8220;What canals?&#8221;
&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Professor <small>FANSEE</small>, somewhat taken
aback, &#8220;we on earth notice straight lines across your
globe every spring, and we reached the conclusion
that they are canals used to guide the water when
it rushes down from the thawing ice-fields at the
poles.&#8221; &#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the Martian, &#8220;this is extremely
interesting. Straight lines you say? Let me think
a moment. Oh, yes, they are....&#8221;</p>

<p>Here a strange thing occurred. We heard a
few clicks of a nature to suggest that the apparatus
had suddenly gone out of order. The Professor
looked over some of the details of the machinery,
but found nothing wrong. Then, of a sudden, the
Martian communications were resumed. With a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
speed as if our distant philosopher had suddenly
turned into a maniac, his message was now rushing in.</p>

<p>One of the nations involved in this miserable
cataclasm, known as the Chopper-Knees, it said, has
at the last moment invented an engine of destruction
excelling all others in deadliness. It consists of
an enormous thin metal globe, to which a device is
attached that causes it to fly up in the air to a considerable
height. The device is timed; so that, when
it has reached a certain height and has drifted in a
certain direction, it suddenly comes to a standstill,
and by its own dead weight falls with increasing
speed toward the soil. The horror of it is that upon
reaching the surface it explodes, and spreads a thick
cloud of smoke, of such a nature that by powerful
electrical action it gathers unto itself various materials
from the atmosphere and from the soil, with
the result that the cloud, instead of diminishing,
grows ever thicker and vaster. The cloud kills all
life it comes in contact with, and it is feared that
it may encircle the whole planet. It is guaranteed
to kill every forest and every animal that lives in
the forest, to kill every living creature in the water
whose surface it touches. It is guaranteed to kill
every flower, every grassblade, every thistle; to kill
the ass who is eating the thistle as a much desired
delicacy, as well as the flies that pester his bushy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hide; and as a minor effect, it will also kill the followers
of <small>NAZARRO</small> who, according to the legend, once
rode through the streets of Jairoosolom on his patient
back. As I have erected my apparatus on the
highest promontory of the planet Mars, just as you
probably have done at your end, I shall be the last
to be attacked by the deadly fumes. Already do I
see the cloud fill the valley below me. I see it rising,
rising!...</p>

<p>And then, as if in the despair of his agony he
were addressing a world already laid waste, and a
race already wiped out, a few additional sentences
reached us from the depth of space: Abandon your
petty jealousies, your tricky international schemes
and your malice. Form a friendly federation by
which everyone of you will benefit. Establish international
courts of justice and of honor. Do away
with your national armies and navies, and use their
remnants as international guardians of the peace.
Give up your futile efforts to be guided by blind
Nature in the treatment of your fellowmen. Morality,
whether considered from an international or
a national point of view, is a set of rules of wholesome
living, founded on the requirements of an ever
further developing social organization. It does not
refer merely to a respectable limitation of sex-life.
It embraces good-will, loyalty, justice, fairness, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
absence of all underhand thoughts and methods, and
the total lack of malicious intent. Many of these
laws have been lucidly compiled in the Nazarrano
manuscripts. Enthrone ye then, therefore, once
more, if not <small>NAZARRO&#8217;S</small> divinity, then at least such
of His precepts as are practicable and beneficent for
men of all faiths and for men of no faith, for the
human race at large!... Thus alone shall ye
thrive without unnecessary disturbances, social upheavals,
industrial calamities, wanton slaughter, and
without the despicable arousal of savage passions!</p>

<p>The Martian admonition ceased. And then I
saw Professor <small>FANSEE</small> grow deadly pale; and as
he reeled as if about to swoon, he whispered: &#8220;I
feel as if my mind were giving way. That voice,
that solemn message, did it come from space, or did
it come to me from the heaps of the dead and dying
that I seem to see dispersed on the battlefields of
Belgium, France, and Poland? Was this the voice
of departing spirits dying on our fair earth itself?&#8221;
&#8220;Since we left for these vast fields of ice,&#8221; he said
to me with a sickly smile, &#8220;many things may have
happened!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he swooned indeed, and it took fully
six hours to bring him back to consciousness. From
then on it was evident that he was suffering from
some mysterious disease, of which he died two weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
later. Had the electrical cloud that enveloped
Mars, entering the communicating-apparatus, anything
to do with this mysterious functional disturbance?
My own knowledge of medicine is limited,
and we had no physician with us. His remains
were buried in the ice of the South Pole. The problem
may never fully be answered.</p>

<p>And now, while I am preparing this narrative
for publication, as yet far away from civilization
and ignorant of recent events, I wonder whether the
malicious nationality-mania, that dreadful mental
aberration to which the Martian philosopher referred,
could ever have developed to the same extent
among civilized humanity on earth, arraying
Christian nation against Christian nation! I wonder,
in case this malady hereafter ever threatened to
become acute, whether it could not easily be cured
by a wise and systematic application of calm commonsense.</p>

<p>May all good men stand together to eradicate
this evil!</p>
